# Q-A-All-tech--Issue-solver
This is where you ask any questions about tech issues, including Software, Hardware, D.I.Y. Tech, Artificial intelligence, and more.
I wanted to make a community where techies, nerds, and geeks can ask questions about all types of technology. Including but not limited to hypothetical, and theories. So feel free to ask or answer anything you like.

The not-so-fun thing:
RULES:
1. Respect others
2. No trolling
3. Try to keep cursing to a minimum.
4. Please no sexual comments, use DM for that.
5. This is not a dating site. Again DM the person, but ask before you do. It's called "R.E.S.P.E.C.T, find out what it means to me." Sings it. See *Rule 1.
6. NO dirty Pictures, again DM the person.
7. This is a place of safety for all to get help or be helpful and knowledgeable of technology.
8. More rules to come

Enjoy,
Admin
